You can now leverage Automation AI Use Cases and Search AI Answers to automate regular customer queries and seamlessly transfer them to a human agent as needed. The new Campaigns module helps streamline outbound voice and web campaigns. It provides templates and analytics to easily create targeted campaigns, reach audiences efficiently, track performance, and achieve goals more effectively.

The key features and experience changes are summarized below.


### Experience Flows


#### Improved Experience Flows 

To reduce confusion, the OnConnect/Welcome Events have now been merged into the new Experience Flows. With XO11, the logic typically written in these events can now be easily managed via experience flows.


#### Updated Flow Builder

The Flow Builder interface has been revamped to provide a smoother, more intuitive user experience. The interface is similar to the Dialog Builder, making the transition seamless and effortless.

### LLM and Generative AI Framework

Key Updates to LLM & Generative AI Framework are summarized below.

#### Guardrails

Large language models (LLMs) are powerful AI systems that can be leveraged to offer human-like conversational experiences. The Kore.ai XO Platform offers a wide range of features to leverage the power of LLMs. LLMs are usually pre-trained with a vast corpus of public data sources, and the content is not fully reviewed and curated for correctness and acceptability for enterprise needs. This results in generating harmful, biased, or inappropriate content at times. The XO Platform's Guardrail framework mitigates these risks by validating LLM requests and responses to enforce safety and appropriateness standards.

Guardrails enable responsible and ethical AI practices by allowing developers to easily enable/disable rules and configure settings for different features using LLMs. Additionally, platform users can design and implement fallback behaviors for a feature, such as triggering specific events, if a guardrail detects content that violates set standards.

#### Monitoring

It offers comprehensive insights into utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) and Generative AI features. The framework collects, analyzes, and presents comprehensive data on user interactions, request-response dynamics, and payload details. It enables platform users to track and compare usage across various LLM features and refine prompts and settings to boost performance and user experience.

## Search AI Updates

Kore.ai’s SearchAssist capabilities are now available under Search AI on the XO Platform. Search AI offers AI-powered conversational search tools to quickly and accurately retrieve information from vast datasets and offer the most relevant piece of information to users. Add multiple data sources for building your answer index, including website crawlers, structured data, unstructured documents, catalogs, and knowledge bases. By combining Automation AI (Use Cases) and Search AI (Answers), businesses can create an exceptional, seamless conversational experience for their users.

Key Search AI (Answers) capabilities are summarized below. 

### Content Extraction Strategies

To generate answers using the source data, the ingested data is segmented into smaller segments or chunks to understand better, organize, and efficiently retrieve the most relevant set of data when required. Selecting the most appropriate strategy requires considering several factors, like the type of content, the embedding model to store chunks, the expected length and complexity of user queries and answers, etc.

The application supports various chunk-generation strategies. You have the flexibility to select and customize the strategies based on the format and structure of the ingested data or as per the answers required. You can configure multiple strategies to apply to different types of content. This improves the precision of answers by aligning the strategy to the document characteristics and gives you flexibility and granular control over the answers generated.  
<img src="../images/xo-platform-Content-Extraction- Strategies.png" alt="Content Extraction Strategies" title="Content Extraction Strategies" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:70%;">

#### Chunk Browser

The Chunk Browser provides a tool for observing the extracted chunks from the source data. It gives insight into the extraction process's output and enables subsequent actions like editing and rectifying the chunks. 

* **Observation and Verification:** You can use the Chunk Browser to inspect and verify the extracted chunks. This step is crucial for ensuring the correctness of the extraction process, the accuracy of the chunks generated, and the preservation of data.  
<img src="../images/xo-platform-Chunk Browser.png" alt="Chunk Browser" title="Chunk Browser" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:70%;">

* **Editing of Chunks**: You can edit the chunk information directly within the browser interface. This capability can help you add any missed information, edit inaccurate information, or simply enrich the extracted information.  
<img src="../images/xo-platform-Chunk Viewer.png" alt="Chunk Viewer" title="Chunk Viewer" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:70%;">


#### Index Configuration

Indexing is the process of generating vectors or embeddings from the extracted chunks and creating a knowledge Index that can be used to generate answers. Vectors or Embeddings are multidimensional numerical representations of the chunks that carry their semantic information. Embedding Models are algorithms that can translate data into vectors. The XO platform supports various embedding models, such as MPNet, LaBSE, and e5, and allows you to choose a model according to your specific needs.  
<img src="../images/xo-platform-Index.png" alt="Index" title="Index" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:70%;">

### Answer Generation Strategies

Search AI uses LLM to generate answers from the ingested chunks. The efficacy of the response depends on the Chunk Retrieval method and the Answer Generation configuration.

#### Chunk Retrieval Strategy

Choose the preferred chunk retrieval strategy for retrieving answer chunks from the answer index for a given query. Search AI supports **Vector Retrieval**, which uses cosine similarity scores, and **Hybrid Retrieval**, which considers patterns and structures in the text. The choice between using vector retrieval and hybrid retrieval depends on various factors, including the nature of the data, the specific requirements of the application, and the available resources.  
<img src="../images/xo-platform-Chunk Retrieval.png" alt="Notes" title="Notes" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:70%;">

* **Vector Retrieval**: In this type of retrieval, we compute the cosine similarity between the query vector and each chunk vector at the time of query, and the resulting scores are used to filter and sort the results. The score ranges from 0 to 1, where 0 indicates no match, and 1 represents a complete match.
* **Hybrid Retrieval**: In this type of retrieval, multiple approaches are used to find the most relevant chunk corresponding to the query.

#### Answers Generation

Configure the type of answers to be presented to the users:

* **Extractive Answers**: The topmost chunk retrieved in response to the user query is directly presented to the user as answers. The extractive answers are exact content retrieved from the chunks without any change in text.
* **Generative Answers**: The top chunks retrieved in response to the user query are sent to the configured LLM, which generates a paraphrased answer from the content in the chunks. Use the following fields to configure Generative Answers.  
<img src="../images/xo-platform-Generative Answers.png" alt="Generative Answer" title="Generative Answer" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:70%;">

### Search vs. Automation Setting

You can either keep Automation First and Answers as a fallback or otherwise.  
<img src="../images/xo-platform-Search vs. Automation Setting.png" alt="Search vs. Automation Setting" title="Search vs. Automation Setting" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:70%;">

The available options are as follows:

* **Proactive Mode**: This widget automates intent identification, entity extraction, and transcript generation. It also allows for automatic (proactive) transcript logging and intent suggestions. By default, this widget is enabled for all three channels.
* **Agent Coaching**: This widget enables real-time agent coaching based on analyzing agent utterances and speech. You can set up specific utterances and speech patterns for AgentAssist to take relevant actions, such as providing hints and nudges or emailing the manager when those patterns occur. By default, it is disabled for all channels and is only available for chat and voice channels.
* **Agent Playbook**: This widget provides agents with structured guidance and helps streamline task management. Supervisors can define stages and steps to follow, choose step progression (sequential or random), mark whether the steps are completed manually or automatically, and set adherence notifications. They can leverage this feature to gain valuable insights into agent adherence to specific playbook steps and use this data to enhance agents’ ability to handle interactions and significantly improve customer satisfaction. By default, this widget is disabled, but you can enable it for all three channels.
* **Send Button**: This option controls the accessibility of the Send button functionality for AgentAssist responses. By default, it’s enabled for Voice and Chat channels.
* **Copy Button**: This option controls the accessibility of the Copy button functionality for AgentAssist responses. By default, it’s enabled for all three channels.
* **Transcript Tab**: This option controls the appearance of the Transcript tab in the AgentAssist widget. By default, this widget is enabled and available for the Chat channel only.
* **Auto Summarization**: This option controls the automatic generation of a summary of the conversation when it ends. Agents can copy the summary and save it into the Notes or Remark field while closing the conversation. By default, it’s enabled for Voice and Chat channels only, and it also has the option to select the Submit button.
* **Widget Landing Tab**: This option allows you to select the default landing page for your selected channel and is available for all three channels.

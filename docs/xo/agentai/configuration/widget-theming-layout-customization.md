#### Widget Menu Layout

This section lets you enable or disable the Agent AI widget menus - **Assist Home**, **Search**, **My Bot**, and **Transcript** (for the Voice channel). You can position the menus at the bottom or the side by clicking the **Bottom **or **Side** options at the top or shuffle the menus with the drag-and-drop action. To automatically position the menus based on the pixel level, select the **Responsive** option. If the pixel size is less than 600, the menus move to the bottom, and for more than 600, the menus move to the left. The following screenshot shows a disabled **Search** menu, **Side** positioning of the enabled menus, and the shuffled **Assist Home** menu with the **My Bot** menu:

The disabled menus do not appear on the widget unless you enable them back.

#### Assist Action Menu Layout

This section lets you enable, disable, and customize the placement of the action buttons in the **Assist** tab. You can use the toggle to enable or disable the buttons and the drag-and-drop action to shuffle their position. The following screenshot shows all enabled action buttons with the **Restart** button position shuffled with the **Sentiment **button: \

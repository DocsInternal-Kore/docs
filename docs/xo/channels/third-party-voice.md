# Third Party Voice Channels

By default, your Virtual Assistant is not available to users unless you define one or more channels through which it can communicate. You can add voice delivery channels that end-users can use to access and interact with it when deployed.
You can also enable your VA in third-party voice channels such as Amazon Alexa, Twilio Voice, IVR-AudioCodes, and IVR. 

You can add third-party voice channels to your VA from the **Channels & Flows** > **Channels** > **Third Party Voice** > **All** section.

## Enable a Channel

To enable one or more channels for your VA, follow the below steps:

1. Open the assistant for which you want to add the channels.
2. Go to **Channels & Flows** > **Channels** > **Third Party Voice** > **All**.
3. Click the channel you want to add. This opens the instructions page to install the channel.
4. Click **Next** or the **Configuration** tab to open the configuration page for the channel. The following image shows the configuration page of the Amazon Alexa channel.

    !!! Note

        After adding the channel, the bot needs to be published for approval and the Bot Admin needs to approve the bot (with new channels). The new channel is not available to users until the Bot Admin explicitly approves that channel for your assistant.

5. The configured channel is displayed on the Configured tab of the Third Party Voice page and same channel is removed from the All tab.

## Testing,  Disabling or Deleting Channels


To **test**, **disable or delete the channel**, go to **Channels & Flows** > **Channels** > **Third Party Voice** > **Configured** list, hover over the channel and click more option in the top right corner. Click Test, Disable, or Delete as required and follow the instructions.


!!! Warning

    Deletion is permanent and cannot be undone. You will be asked to confirm your choice, so make sure this is exactly what you want to do.

!!! note

    Please also note that channel edits will only take effect within your live assistant after publishing the In Development version of the VA with the channel enabled. For more information, please see Publishing your Virtual Assistant.

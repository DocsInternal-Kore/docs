The **Plan Information** section provides information on your current plans for all the products. You can also view your billing cycle, modify your current plans, and compare them from here. On the analytics-driven **Usage Trends** dashboard, you can monitor the usage patterns of your App Interactions with customers.

## Billing Session

### Key Billing Rules

* Automation AI: Billed per 15-minute of activity.
* CCaaS: Billed per Agent Seats (named or concurrent).
* Add-ons: Billed separately. 

### Product-Specific Billing Sessions

* Automation AI: A billing session is 15 minutes of user conversation with the bot. For example, if a user converses with the bot for 31 minutes, it would be counted as 3 sessions (0-15, 16-30, 31-End).
* Search AI: This is included in Automation AI, and the same billing session is applied. 
* Contact Center AI: It’s billed per the agent seats:
    * Named Seats: Each agent gets a dedicated seat. For example, if 100 agents work across 3 shifts, you will be billed for 100 seats.
    * Concurrent Seats: This is based on the maximum number of simultaneously logged-in agents. For example, if a maximum of 50 agents work per shift across 3 shifts (150 total agents), you will be billed only for 50 seats.  
* Agent AI: It’s billed per the agent seats, similar to Contact Center AI as explained above.
* Add-ons: They are billed separately from the plan. For details, see the Add-ons and Services section on the [pricing](https://kore.ai/pricing/) page.

### Credit/Debit Card

Initiate the transaction for paid credits using a valid credit/debit card. Add the _card number_, _account holder’s name_, _expiry date_, and _CVV security code_ to authorize the transaction and validate using an OTP.

### Wire Transfer

Select the wire transfer payment mode while adding funds. A wire transfer is a form of electronic payment that sends money directly from one bank account (Payer) to another (Payee).

**Important Considerations**

* **View Order Details**: When you place an order by selecting the wire transfer method, it gets registered with pending payment clearance status. The order summary page provides you the total amount to transfer along with the break-up summary. Meanwhile, you should also receive an email from Paypro with the detailed steps to complete your Wire Transfer order. 
 
  <img src="../images/up(12).png" alt="order details" title="Order details" style="border: 1px solid gray;"/>

* **Ability to Add Funds during pending Wire Transfer**: A Wire Transfer process may take four to eight days to complete. The paid credits are loaded only after the transfer is successful. If the VA runs out of balance and your Wire Transfer order is still in ‘Pending’ status, you can add funds using an alternative payment method like a credit card or PayPal.

## Deployment Flow

The admin can take action for a Standard Workspace app deployment request based on the following scenarios:

**Standard Workspace with Free Credits**

The admin user can approve a deployment request without constraints/checks or any plan selection flows if the workspace has free credits.

**Standard Workspace without Free Credits**

If the standard workspace has exhausted all the free credits, the admin cannot approve the publish request until funds/ credits are added to the account.

**Standard Workspace with Paid Credits**

If an account has paid credits, then the admin user can approve the deployment flow.

## Emails and Notifications

The Platform sends notifications and marketing emails to the bot developers/account owners at various stages of their Bot-building journey. For the **Usage Plans** feature. In a nutshell, these emails are classified as follows:


* Signup and Sign-in Flows.
* Ecommerce Flows (Manual and Auto-approvals).
* Support Plans, Marketing, and notifications.
* Invitation emails
* Publish and Other Update Emails.

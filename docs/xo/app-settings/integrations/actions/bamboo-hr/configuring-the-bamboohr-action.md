# **Configuring the BambooHR Action**

The XO Platform lets you easily connect the HubSpot integration to create, view, and update employees. You can also search and view time off requests, who is out and update request status using the pre-built templates. 

This document explains how to enable, authorize, configure, and install the BambooHR pre built templates.


## Authorizations Supported

The Kore.ai XO Platform supports basic authentication to allow BambooHR integration to exchange data. For more information, read the [Bot Authorization Overview](https://developer.kore.ai/docs/bots/advanced-topics/authorization/bot-authentication/){:target="_blank"} article.

The Kore.ai XO Platform supports the following authorization types for the BambooHR integration:

* **Pre-Authorize the Integration** – To make the integration process smoother for developers and customers, you can pre-authorize it by providing the necessary authorization credentials to obtain the access token. 
* **Allow Users to Authorize the Integration** – This method requires the end user to provide credentials during the conversation for authorization. This authorization process involves requesting permission for Kore.ai’s BambooHR app to access an access token at runtime. To learn more about BambooHR account types, see [BambooHR documentation](https://documentation.bamboohr.com/docs){:target="_blank"}.


## Step 1: Enable the BambooHR Action

**Prerequisites**:

Before enabling the BambooHR action, complete the following prerequisites:

* If you don’t have BambooHR account credentials, create a developer account in BambooHR and note down login credentials. Use the [BambooHR Documentation](https://documentation.bamboohr.com/docs){:target="_blank"} for more information.
* Copy the user sub domain and API key values and keep them for future use to enable the integration.

Steps to enable the BambooHR action:

1. Go to **Build > Integrations > Actions**.
2. Once you click the **Actions** menu, all integrations are shown in the **Available** region. Select the **BambooHR** action.

### Pre-authorize the Integration

**Basic Auth**

You can authorize the integration using your credentials. The developer authorization lets you authorize the integration with preconfigured Kore.ai’s app with the Basic Auth option.

Steps to authorize a BambooHR action using developer credentials:

1. Go to **Build > Integrations > Actions**.
2. Select the **BambooHR** action in the **Available Actions** region.
3. In the **Configurations** dialog, select the **Authorization** tab.
4. Enter the following details:
    * **Authorization Type** – Select the **Pre-authorize the Integration** option, and then select the **Basic Auth** option.  
    <img src="../images/bamboo-hr-img2.png" alt="Authorization Type-Basic Auth" title="Authorization Type-Basic Auth" style="border: 1px solid gray;zoom:50%;"/>
    * **API Key** – The secret API key of your BambooHR account.

5. Click **Enable**. When you configure the action for the first time, the **Integration Successful**  pop-up is displayed.

**Note**: You will notice the BambooHR action is moved from _Available_ to _Configured_ region.


### Allow End User to Authorize

You can authorize the integration at a user level with their login credentials. The user authorization process involves requesting permission for Kore.ai’s BambooHR app to access an access token at runtime. You can also use the basic auth profile to let a user configure the integration at runtime.

Steps to authorize a BambooHR action at a user level:

1. Go to **Build > Integrations > Actions**.
2. Select the **BambooHR** action in the **Available Actions** region.
3. In the Configurations dialog, select the **Authorization** tab.
4. Enter the following details:
    * **Authorization Type** – Select the **Allow Users to Authorize the Integration** option, and then select the **Basic Auth** option.
        * Create your authorization profile to obtain an access token and use it to complete integration without using Kore.ai’s BambooHR app for authorization.
    * Click the **Select Authorization** drop-down and select the **Create New** option.  
    <img src="../images/bamboo-hr-img4.png" alt="Create New" title="Create New" style="border: 1px solid gray;zoom:50%;"/>
    * Select the type of authorization mechanism. For example, select the **Basic Auth** option. To create Basic Auth profiles, see [Bot Authorization Overview](https://developer.kore.ai/docs/bots/advanced-topics/authorization/bot-authentication/){:target="_blank"}.

    * Select _Yes; some tasks will have tenancy URLs, and the user must provide the URLs to successfully authenticate_.
    * _Base URL_ – Enter the base tenant URL for the BambooHR instance.
    * _Authorization Check URL_ – Enter the authorization check URL for your BambooHR instance.

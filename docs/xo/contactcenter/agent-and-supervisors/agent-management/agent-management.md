# **Agent Management**

## Agents

In the Contact Center, the term **Agent Management** refers to the management of agents (customer support representatives), supervisors, and administrators with an account within the contact center. To serve customers, you must add users to contact center and provide them with the necessary access. You can create user profiles, assign them to voice, chat, or both channels, and specific skills or queues.

You can find the _Agents_ section by going to **Contact Center > AGENT & SUPERVISORS > Agent Management**.

### Conversation Status Configuration

For each status, you can configure the following:

1. **The response time after which the status should trigger**: This can be set in either as a percent value of a total or as minutes and seconds.
    1. The statuses for which you can set a percent value are: _Due Reminder For Agent_, and _Idle Reminder For Customer._
    2. The statuses for which you can set a response time (in minutes and seconds) are: _Overdue, Agent Inactivity, Idle_, and _Auto Expire_.
    3. The statuses that do not require percentile or response time configuration are: _On Connect, On Interruption_, and _On Close_.

    The following applies to emails:
    4. The statuses for which you can set a response time (in hours) are _Due Reminder for Agent Inactivity_, and _Due Reminder for Auto Expiry_.
    5. The status for which there is no response time is _On Close_.
    6. The statuses for which you can set a response time (in hours and minutes) are _Overdue_, Agent _Inactivity_, _Agent Offline_, _Customer Idle_, and _Auto Expire_.
2. **The messaging goes out to either the user or the agent**. Status
Messages can be edited by clicking the Edit icon under the Message column. 
<img src="../images/status-edit.png" alt="Status Edit" title="Status Edit" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:80%;">

    7. Each status lets you edit the message text, add variables and select the language.
    <img src="../images/status-pop-up.png" alt="Status Message Dialog Box" title="Status Message Dilaog Box" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:80%;">

    8. **To add a variable**, place the cursor where you want to insert the variable, click the **Variable** field, then select the one you need. This adds a variable placeholder in your message text, which will be replaced with contextual information once the message reaches its recipient. You can select more than one variable within the same message.
    For example: `{{agentFirstName}}` becomes Christine Mark.

### Allow Agent to Pause/Resume

By default, the Allow Agent to Pause/Resume feature is disabled. However, admins can enable it for agents handling voice interactions, allowing them to pause the recording during the call.

### Allow Virtual Assistant Dialogs to Pause/Resume

By default, the Allow Virtual Assistant to Pause/Resume feature is disabled. However, admins can enable it for virtual assistants (automation) handling voice interactions, allowing them to pause the recording when collecting [Personally Identifiable Information](https://docs.kore.ai/smartassist/history/handling-pii-data/) (PII).

Recorded calls are accessible to supervisors on the Dashboard’s [Interactions](https://docs.kore.ai/smartassist/dashboard/interactions/#Call_Recording) tab. The interactions are not recorded in the interactions tab for the duration that the recording was stopped/paused.

Changes to the Call Recording Control settings are logged on the [Kore.ai Bots Admin Console](https://bots.kore.ai/admin/#_login) > Analytics > [Audit Report page](https://docs.kore.ai/smartassist/bot-administration/audit-report/).

## Transfers

### Transfer to External Contacts

If enabled, this option allows agents to transfer ongoing customer calls to the external contacts list, via the Agent Console. Please see [Agent Console > Transfer Interactions](https://docs.kore.ai/smartassist/console/interacting-with-customers/#Transfer_Interactions) to learn more.

### Enforce Skill Match for Transfers

If enabled, the system considers skills while finding an agent, during a queue transfer. If disabled, the system ignores skills while finding an agent, during a queue transfer.
<img src="../images/enforce-skill-match-for-transfers.png" alt="Enable Enforce Skill Match for Transfers" title="Enable Enforce Skill Match for Transfers" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:80%;">

### Transfer Destinations

Supervisors can decide where agents can transfer interactions: 

* **Queues & Agents**: Agents can transfer interactions to queues and other individual agents.
* **Queues only**: Agents can transfer interactions only to queues.
<img src="../images/transfer-destinations.png" alt="Transfer Destinations" title="Transfer Destinations" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:80%;">

## Skill Modification

If enabled, the system allows agents to modify skills attached to an interaction.

You can select from the following options:

* **Live Interaction**: Selecting this option lets agents modify skills from the skills bar on the Live Interaction window.
* **Transfer**: Selecting this option lets agents modify skills when transferring an interaction.

Enabling the setting allows administrators to configure the following rules:

**Auto Logout**: The period of inactivity after which auto logout occurs. The default setting is 8 hours.

<img src="../images/auto-logout-configuration.png" alt="Configure Auto Logout" title="Configure Auto Logout" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:80%;">

By default, the snooze functionality is disabled. Administrators can turn on the **Snooze** toggle to enable the functionality.

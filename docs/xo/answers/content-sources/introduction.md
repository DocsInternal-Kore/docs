# Introduction

Business organizations use multiple sources to store diverse information and data. These sources include the company website, blogs, help centers, user guides, product catalogs, and sometimes, third-party knowledge bases. For instance, a company typically showcases its products and services on its website, accompanied by detailed information in the help center. Frequently, terms and conditions associated with these offerings can be found in PDF files or as FAQs on the website. Locating specific information can be a tedious task for the users.

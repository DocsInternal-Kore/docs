# Connectors

You can ingest content into the application from diverse sources including third-party repositories like ServiceNow, Microsoft SharePoint, Atlassianâ€™s Confluence, IBM Domino, etc. using the **connectors** and provide your users with a seamless search experience.

XO Answers provides custom connectors to enable crawling specific third-party content management applications, CRM systems, web database applications,  or cloud-based applications. The application can be configured to connect to multiple systems simultaneously using a connector for each third-party application.

Connectors enable the application to establish a connection with the third-party application. After the connection is established and authentication is complete, the data from the third-party application is processed and indexed and is able as answers to search queries. The access privileges of the content are maintained as per the privileges assigned to the user in the third-party repository. This implies that only the files accessible to the user in the configuration of the connector can appear in search results.

By default, the application provides connectors for most of the commonly used applications and the list will continue to grow. For any specific integration requirements, please [contact us](https://kore.ai/contact-us/).

## Configuring a Connector

To configure a new connector, go to the **Connectors** tab under the **Sources** page. This page lists the connectors which are already configured with the application. For a new connector, click on the **+Connect** button.

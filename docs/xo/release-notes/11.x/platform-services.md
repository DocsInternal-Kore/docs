#### Support for Thread Handling for Virtual Assistants in Slack Channels

The Platform now offers native support for threaded conversations in the Slack channel. Users can initiate a new thread from any message within a Slack channel or direct message group.

Additionally, the platform provides extended functionality for developers. It can automatically create a new thread whenever a user \@mentions the virtual assistant in a Slack channel. This behavior is configurable, giving developers control over this feature.

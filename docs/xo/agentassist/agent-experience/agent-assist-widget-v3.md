# **AgentAssist **

The AgentAssist is an AI powered virtual assistant to optimize contact center agent performance. It offers seamless assistance, promoting enhanced productivity and improved customer satisfaction. Its user-friendly interface and real-time support capabilities let agents effortlessly solve complex customer interactions.

The following features are available in the AgentAssist widget:



* **Dialog Tasks**: Configured Use Cases that trigger when a customer’s utterance matches the content of a Dialog Task. Designed to help agents minimize manual typing by copy-pasting the relevant answers from the Dialog Tasks. [Learn more](https://docs.kore.ai/agentassist/use-cases/dialogues-creation/).
* **Playbooks**: Contact center agents are expected to provide the best customer experience despite high call volumes and complex interactions. To empower agents in this endeavor, AgentAssist introduces the Playbook feature—a standard tool offering structured guidance for handling customer interactions. [Learn more](https://docs.kore.ai/agentassist/agent/agentassist-playbook/).
* **Real-time Agent Coaching**: Real-time coaching for the agents based on the analysis of agent utterances and speech. You can set up specific utterances and speech patterns for AgentAssist to take relevant actions, such as providing hints and nudges or emailing the manager when those patterns occur. [Learn more](https://docs.kore.ai/agentassist/agent/agent-coaching/).
* **Real-time Sentiment Analysis**: Provides a continuous, time-based graph that displays the customer’s sentiment fluctuations. Agents get immediate visibility of the evolving emotional tone of the conversation and take proactive and empathetic responses. [Learn more](https://docs.kore.ai/agentassist/agent/bot-override-and-automation/#Sentiment_Analysis).
* **Transcription**: Enhances agent accessibility and context by providing accurate transcriptions of user and agent voices during interactions. Offers a conversation overview and serves as the basis for automated Quality Assessment (QA). Agents receive a visual indicator when an intent is identified, improving real-time understanding and response.
* **Auto Summarization**: Automatically shortens lengthy information into concise summaries, enabling agents to respond promptly to customer inquiries. It helps agents quickly understand and make decisions.
* **PII Redaction**: Securely removes Personally Identifiable Information (PII) from the agent's view and transcripts, ensuring a safe environment for customer interactions and compliance with privacy regulations. [Learn more](https://developer.kore.ai/docs/bots/bot-settings/pii-data-masking/).
* **Feedback**: Empowers agents to provide real-time feedback on suggestions. This continuous process forms a dynamic loop, allowing Machine Learning (ML) algorithms to continuously enhance and customize recommendations for accurate and contextually relevant outcomes.
* **Next Best Action**: Enhances the product by enabling seamless execution of Dialog Tasks for swift customer query resolution. The generative AI nodes and script nodes integration equips the system to efficiently communicate with external systems through API calls. This leads to improved customer experience and reduced necessity for frequent screen changes for agents. This allows agents to deliver contextually relevant next-best responses, contributing to a more streamlined and effective contact center operation.
* **Multi-language Support**: Provides multiple language support, enabling agents to switch between languages instantaneously. It ensures seamless communication with users in diverse linguistic environments. Agents can engage with customers in their preferred language, providing a more personalized and efficient support experience.
* **Knowledge AI**: Allows customization of Knowledge AI search result displays with control over search results presentation, the option to display auto suggestions in the Ask AgentAssist search bar, and optimization of the search experience through advanced Knowledge AI API configuration, offering both Basic and Advanced options.

## **Widget Tabs**

The widget consists of five tabs–Search, My Bot, Assist, Transcript, and Settings–to help the agents perform different tasks and activities.

**AgentAssist tabs:**

### **Search Tab**

This tab shows all configured Dialog Tasks at the bot level and also gives search capabilities wherein agents can search Dialog Tasks, frequently asked questions (FAQs), Generative AI answers, web pages, files, and more. The content in this section dynamically updates based on all agent interactions. The agents can scroll through the list to get visibility of all the automations that are readily available to execute. If you click the ellipsis and select "Run with Agent’s input", the dialog moves to the My Bot section, and you can run the dialog from there.

<img src="../agent-experience/widget-images/search-tab.png" alt="search-tab.png" title="search-tab.png" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:80%;">

The following buttons are available in this section:



* **Run button**: For Dialog Tasks. Click to run a configured Dialog Task.
* **Run with Agent’s input**: Click this button to run a Dialog Task with agent’s input. The agent can customize the content and decide whether to send a dialog or not. Selecting this option automatically moves you to the My Bot section.


### **My Bot Tab**

My Bot functionality allows agents to run the entire automation by themselves. Agents provide inputs to the bot and obtain the desired results.

My Bot tab displays the list of “next best action” suggestions for the agent based on the current conversation status and other interaction parameters.

<img src="../agent-experience/widget-images/mybot-tab.png" alt="mybot-tab.png" title="mybot-tab.png" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:80%;">

My bot functionality can be used in multiple circumstances (but not limited to): 



* If Automation fails, the agent can rerun it by providing inputs manually, which helps to reduce the average handle time (AHT) and makes it less frustrating for customers as they don’t have to repeat the same information.
* Agents can run MyBot automation in parallel and seek information directly from the bot.


### **Assist Tab**

The Assist tab is the primary interface for the agents. AgentAssist actively monitors conversations and offers assistance to agents. Through the Assist tab, customer intents in the form of Dialog Tasks, FAQs, KnowledgeAI, and Playbook are identified. Agents can run automation processes and send FAQs, Playbook body text, and Dialog Task text to users. The Assist tab displays Dialog Tasks, Playbooks, and Agent Coaching progression. For these features to be available, they should be configured on your device. This section also displays a “bulb” icon if there is a Dynamic Playbook match.

<img src="../agent-experience/widget-images/assist-tab-png" alt="assist-tab-png" title="assist-tab-png" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:80%;">

The Assist tab facilitates the following:



* Guide agents through conversations by providing the best response suggestions.
* Automatic retrieval of information from knowledge base (KB) based on user intent.
* Provide structured training and coaching to agents.
* Run bot for customers based on customer-provided information.
* Provide a historical view to look at the previously executed automation.
* View Conversation History for chat conversations– The **History** tab shows the record of user-bot interaction.
* Send/Copy button 
* Feedback for Dialog Task and Knowledge AI

The Assist tab features the following:



    * **Running Playbook stages: **Shows the total and adhered stages of a running playbook. For example, 1/3 means 1 out of 3 stages of a playbook has been adhered to.
    * **Proceed to Close:** This button is available when a playbook is running. Clicking this button leads to a change in the playbook running status from Open to Close, and agents are prompted to ask if the customer needs any other help before ending the call.
    * **Playbook adherence button**: If a Playbook is running, adherence to a step happens automatically when the agent’s utterance matches exactly with the Playbook step adherence utterance. If it doesn’t match, the agent can click this button to indicate a step has been completed (adhered).
    * **Send/Copy buttons**: These two buttons appear for Playbooks (if enabled) and Dialog Tasks. Click **Send** to send the exact message appearing on the widget, or click **Copy** to customize the message before sending it to the customer.
    * **Resume button**: This button applies to the Playbooks and appears while switching to another playbook while one is already running.
    * **List View**: This is an entity list button. When clicked, a pop-up displays a list of all entity entries present in the conversation.
    * **Restart button**: When clicked, this button provides agents with two options: "Start over" and "Restart with Captured Inputs." These options allow agents to either restart the Dialog Task or continue it by providing input for each entity before restarting.
    * **Termination button**: This button provides agents options to handle ongoing interactions effectively, allowing them to either terminate, cancel, or continue, which involves manual input of customer responses for entity responses.
        * **Option 1: Yes, Terminate**: Terminates the running Dialog Task and provides feedback.
        * **Option 2: No, Cancel**: Closes the pop-up with no actions taken.
        * **Option 3: Continue with Override Mode**: Agents manually enter the response to the customer’s conversation.
    * **Maximize/Minimize button**: This button maximizes/minimizes the displayed page section.


### **Transcript Tab**

The Transcript feature is available specifically for voice calls.

When a voice call begins, the Transcript tab shows the transcripts. This information is in text format, which allows the agent to look up information and copy/paste it.

The Transcript functionality transcribes the audio for the agent and the customer in real-time. Once transcribed, the messages are readily available for the agent throughout the session. Also, it allows the agent to have a historical view for referring back whenever needed.

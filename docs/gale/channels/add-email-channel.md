# Adding the Email Channel

When you add the email channel to your VA, Kore.ai automatically generates the email address that the end-users can send an email for communications with your assistant. By default, the email address syntax is **&lt; bot name >.kore@m.&lt; kore host >**. For example, **myemail.kore@m.app-bots.kore.com**. Optionally, you can click **Change** to add a custom name, such as **MyBot.kore@m.app-bots.kore.com.**

!!! note

      You can add 5000 characters for the email channel. This character limit is configurable for the On-Prem installation.


By adding the email channel to your VA, end-users can interact with it using any standard email client, such as _Microsoft Outlook_ or _Yahoo_.

Steps to add the email channel:


1. In the XO Platform, select the assistant that you want to work with.
2. Go to **Deploy > Channels > Email**.
3. In the **Email** field, you can change the first portion of the address set to the VA name by default.
4. Choose whether you want to send a contact card to all users, as part of the introduction message.
5. Under the **Enable Channel** section, select **Yes **to enable the channel.

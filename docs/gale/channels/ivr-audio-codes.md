2. Go to **Deploy > Channels > IVR-Audiocodes**.
3. Navigate to the **Configurations **tab of this page and associate a secure app by choosing an existing app or by creating a new one.
4. Generate the JWT token using the details of the selected app and use this token for secure communication with the Kore.ai XO Platform.

## Step 2: Configure the Bot URL in AudioCodes

The Webhook URL associated with this assistant should be configured in your AudioAccounts account. Navigate to the **Configurations **tab of this page, copy the Webhook URL, and configure it as the _botURL _in the **VoiceAI Connector** of your AudioCodes account. See the [AudioCodes documentation ](https://techdocs.audiocodes.com/voice-ai-connect/Content/VAIG_API/API_1.htm)for further details.

The names and values are used to include the corresponding property in the VoiceXML definition in the IVR system and Session Parameters in the AudioCodes channel. These values defined for a node or a standard response override the global Call Control Parameters defined in the VA IVR /AudioCodes settings page.
    2. Click **Confirm**.
    3. Click **Save** to complete the process.

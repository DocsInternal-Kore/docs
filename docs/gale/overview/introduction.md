# **Introduction**

Workspace.ai is an end-to-end application that helps you to avoid switching between multiple tabs or applications and perform your tasks easily and effortlessly.

It can fetch data from all your records and you can collaborate on the work objects by creating tasks, meetings, discussions, and documents. Using Workspace.ai, you can converse with your virtual assistant Kora to plan your day, manage tasks, and meetings, and lookup for anything you might need from the system.

For example, using Workspace.ai, the sales team can connect to HubSpot and JIRA to fetch the required data and a product team can connect to JIRA and Spreadsheets to get the data required and access them all from the Workspace.ai application.

# Deploy an Agent

Once the flow-building process is completed and you have tested your flow, you can deploy your agents.

!!! note

    You cannot deploy your app if there are any errors and warnings. You have to fix the errors in the App flow section and then retry to deploy the app.

**To deploy your app, follow these steps**:

1. Click the **Agents endpoint** tab in the left panel.

# Create a New Version of the Flow

You can save versions of your flows, restore the older versions, and delete a version if required. Once you have deployed a flow it will be shown as the Deployed version.

**To create a new version, follow these steps**:

1. Click the down arrow corresponding to the agents on the header of the canvas.

    The **Flow versions** dialog is displayed.

1. Click the **+ icon** to save a version of the flow.

    The **Name the Version** dialog is displayed.

1. Enter a **Name** and **Description** for the flow and click **Save**.

    The version you saved will be the current version. Any changes you make in the flow are auto-saved to the current version.

!!! note

    You can click the 3 dots icon corresponding to the version name to Restore or Delete a version. When you restore a version, the current version goes down to the bottom of the list and the restored version becomes the current version and is moved to the top of the list. If you want to edit a restored version, a new current version is created, and you can save this version with a new name. A deployed version can only be restored but cannot be deleted.

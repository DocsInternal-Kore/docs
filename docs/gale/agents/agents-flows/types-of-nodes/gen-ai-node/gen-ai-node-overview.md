# Gen AI Node

Using the Gen AI node, you can establish connections to any model that you have configured within the Model Studio.

Let's consider a customer support scenario when a customer contacts a company's support line with an issue regarding a product they purchased. Initially, they provide details about the problem they're experiencing and request a refund. However, during the conversation, they realize that the issue can be resolved with troubleshooting guidance instead of a refund.

In response, the customer support representative adjusts the approach, providing step-by-step instructions to help the customer resolve the issue. They also offer additional assistance or alternative solutions if needed, such as exchanging the product or providing a discount for future purchases. This demonstrates the flexibility and adaptability of the support process to meet the customer's changing needs and preferences.

Using the Gen AI nodes helps address these situations by removing the necessity to predict and script every complex scenario within predefined rules and conditions. This approach enables more fluid and natural conversations, ultimately enhancing the end-user experience.

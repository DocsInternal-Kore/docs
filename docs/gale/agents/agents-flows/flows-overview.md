# Flows Overview

GALE's intuitive drag-and-drop interface significantly speeds up the development of AI applications, making the process both easy and efficient. By combining the simplicity of drag-and-drop construction with the sophistication of smart code editing, developers are empowered to build complex AI applications and systems without sacrificing flexibility or control. This approach can be applied across various domains, such as evaluating job candidates, enhancing banking applications, or generating blog content, showcasing GALE's versatility in addressing diverse AI development needs.

Each flow within GALE features an essential input node and output node. Information supplied through the input node or variables is imperative for executing the intended function of the application. Subsequently, the output node furnishes the results generated by the flow, serving as the data source for enterprise systems via the API. Notably, every element created within a flow seamlessly transitions into a deployable API, facilitating seamless integration with other systems.

After completing the flow development, you can proceed to test it and assess whether the application satisfies its intended function.

As an illustration, you could develop an application tailored to a retail business setting, focusing on gathering data related to retail performance, investment activities, and gross margins. Employ the model to evaluate pivotal metrics like Return on Investment (ROI) and produce improvement recommendations based on the assessment.

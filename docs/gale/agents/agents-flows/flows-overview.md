# About Agent Flow

GALE's Agent Flow allows you to quickly build an AI agent using a simple drag-and-drop interface combined with smart code editing. This approach enables developers to quickly create a complex AI agent for various use cases, such as candidate evaluation, banking applications, or content generation, without sacrificing flexibility or control.

Every flow consists of an input node, which receives the necessary information or variables, and an output node, which provides the results generated by the flow. These results can be accessed by other systems through an API, as every element in the flow automatically becomes part of a deployable API.

After building the flow, you can test it to ensure the application functions as intended. For example, you could create an agent for a retail business that collects data on performance, investments, and gross margins. The model can then evaluate key metrics like ROI and provide recommendations for improvement based on the analysis.

# Manage Guardrails

All the scanners have models at the back end so to initiate the necessary input and output scanners, you need to deploy a scanner. Once deployed, this scanner becomes accessible throughout GALE, allowing its utilization across all agents.

**To deploy a scanner, follow these steps**:

1. Click the **Settings** icon on the top navigation bar of the application. The **Settings** page is displayed.
2. Click the **Manage Guardrails** tab from the left navigation pane. The **Manage guardrail models** are displayed on the right side of the page.

    The deployment process is initiated and the status is displayed as “Deploying”. Once the scanner is deployed it is listed in the scanners list when you want to add a new scanner.

    !!! note

        You can click the **Undeploy** button corresponding to the scanner model if you no longer need it.

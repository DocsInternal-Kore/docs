# **Select a template for a prompt**

You can use the pre-defined templates available in GALE while providing prompts to make your experience easy and save time. There are different categories of templates that you can use to get the desired output. The different categories include analyzing documents, writing and conversation, learning, and coding. In each of the categories, there are a few templates that can be used for a specific task. 

For example, if you select the “Writing a blog post” template from the Writing and Conversations category then the sample prompt is ready in the Prompt box which looks like this: “_Generate a blog post on the topic {{topic}} in a {{ tone }} tone_”. Similarly, you can use the “Teach me about GANs” template from the Learning category, and the prompt will look like this: “_Teach me about the topic {{ topic name }} like I am a 5-year-old_”. You can provide the variables and generate the output for your reference. Variables are the values you provide in the curly braces when selecting a prompt template.

!!! note

    In the simple mode, you can remove the curly braces and add the required variable, but in the advanced mode, the data comes from the dataset file that you have selected. For more information about uploading a dataset, see <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Upload a dataset file</span>.

# Overview

Prompts are the basic inputs you provide to an LLM model to generate a required response. Prompts can also be augmented with additional information, such as examples, to help the model understand the context of the input. This can improve the accuracy and relevance of the output, making it more valuable to the user.

Designing effective prompts is critical to training and using LLM. By providing clear and relevant inputs, you can ensure that the models can provide accurate and useful responses to your queries and tasks. The prompt module allows you to experiment with different prompts and models to achieve the desired results.

# Overview

Prompts are the basic inputs you provide to large language models (LLMs) to generate a required response. Prompts can also be augmented with additional information, such as examples, to help the model understand the context of the input. This can improve the accuracy and relevance of the output, making it more valuable to the user.

Designing effective prompts is critical to training and using LLMs. By providing clear and relevant inputs, you can ensure that the models can provide accurate and useful responses to your queries and tasks. The playground interface facilitates experimentation with various prompts and different types of AI models including commercial, open-source, or fine-tuned to achieve the intended outcome.

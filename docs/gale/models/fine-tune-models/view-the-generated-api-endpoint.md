# View the Generated API Endpoint

After the model is deployed, the API endpoint is generated which implies that your fine-tuned model is ready for inferencing externally and across the other sections in GALE.

**To view the API Endpoint, follow these steps**:


1. Click the **Model Endpoint** tab in the left panel on the **Models** page of your fine-tuned model.

    <img src="../images/create-new-api-key.png" alt="Create New API Key" title="Create New API Key" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:80%;">

1. Click the **Copy** icon to copy and share the API Endpoint.

    <img src="../images/generate-api-key.png" alt="Generate API Key" title="Generate API Key" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:80%;">

The API endpoint is available in 3 formats. You can copy and use the same as required.

!!! note

    You will receive an email notification after your model deployment is completed and an API is generated and ready to use.
    
You can use the deployed fine-tuned model in GALE for the following use cases:

* In the Prompt Playground to compare prompts against commercial, open-source, or any other fine-tune model.

* In an agent in the agent flow builder via the Gen AI Node.

# **External Models**

GALE offers flexible options for integrating commercial models.

The integration is done in 2 ways:

* Through the Easy integration method, you can choose a model from a commercial provider like Open AI, Anthropic, or Google and use the respective API key provided by the provider.
* Alternatively, if you hosted your model externally, GALE provides a custom API integration method to seamlessly incorporate it into the platform.

With these options, GALE empowers you to leverage the full potential of your preferred models while enjoying the benefits of our platform's advanced capabilities.

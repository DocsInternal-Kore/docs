# About Models

The Model Studio provides the capability to augment base models by integrating the proprietary data from your enterprise and fine-tuning them directly within the product. This streamlined process enables the base model's fine-tuning to easily achieve task-specific performance. You can seamlessly bring in models from external sources and open-source models, expanding the range of available models to address your needs.

GALE provides you with 3 different options as part of the model studio:

1. **Fine-tuned model**: This section, enables you to perform fine-tuning on an existing model, allowing you to create customized models tailored to your specific needs. For more information, see [Fine-Tuned Models](../models/fine-tune-models/fine-tune-models-overview.md).
2. **Open-source model**: In this section, you can can either choose to deploy from a curated list of 30+ most popular open-source models or bring in any text generation model of your choice from Hugging Face. For more information, see [Open-Source Models](../models/open-source-models/open-source-models-overview.md).
3. **External models**: In this section, you can add commercial models such as Open AI, Anthropic, Azure Open AI, Cohere, and Google. Moreover, if you've hosted any models and wish to integrate them into GALE using API connections, this can be seamlessly achieved in this section. For more information, see [External Models](../models/external-models/external-models-overview.md).

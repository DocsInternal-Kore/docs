# **Overview**

The Model Studio provides the capability to augment base models by integrating the proprietary data from your enterprise and fine-tuning them directly within the product. This streamlined process enables the base model's fine-tuning to easily achieve task-specific performance. You can seamlessly bring in models from external commercial sources and open-source models, expanding the range of available models to address your needs.

GALE provides you with 3 different options as part of the model studio:



1. **Fine-tuning model**: This section, enables you to perform fine-tuning on an existing model, allowing you to create customized models tailored to your specific needs.
2. **Open-source model**: In this section, you can view all the models deployed by Kore.ai that are available for your usage.
3. **External models**: In this section, you can add external commercial models. Moreover, if you've hosted any models and wish to integrate them into GALE using API connections, this can be seamlessly achieved in this section.

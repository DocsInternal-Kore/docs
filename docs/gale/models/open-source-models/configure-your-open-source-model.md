## **Configure your open-source model**

You can modify the general details of the open-source model if required.

**To modify the settings of the open-source model, follow the steps**:

1. Click the **Configurations** tab from the left panel on the **Models** page. The **Configurations** page is displayed.

1. Make any required changes in the Description, or Tags fields, and the changes are auto-saved.
2. You also have the option to suspend your deployed custom model using the **Proceed to undeploy** button. It immediately un-deploys the model and is not available for any inferencing requests. Then the status of the model changes to “**Ready to deploy**”. You can deploy the model again from the Deploy section to use it.

!!! note

    To delete an open-source model, you must undeploy it and then only you can delete it.

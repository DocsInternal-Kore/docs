1. Select a model from the list. For example, you can select the “_google/flan-t5-small_” model and click the model name. A deployment status alert is displayed stating that there will be inference charges once your deployment starts. Click **OK** to confirm with deployment.  
2. As you click the model name the deployment process of the model begins automatically, and the status is displayed as “Deploying” in the list of open-source models.

!!! note

    You will be charged for deployment and inferencing-related costs for each open-source model.


After the deployment process is complete the status is changed to “Deployed”. You can now infer this model across GALE and externally.

!!! note

    You will receive an email notification after your model deployment is completed and an API is generated, and it is ready to use.


You can click the required model from the model listing as shown in the preceding image and go to the **Manage** page. You can find the API endpoint created for this open-source model. To use this model as a service, the generated code is helpful. You can copy it easily as shown in the following image.

    Click the three dots icon corresponding to the **Model name** under the **Open-source models** tab on the **Models** page. A pop-up with a list of options is displayed as shown in the following image. If you choose the API endpoint option, it will navigate you to the API keys section of the Model and if you select the Configurations option, it will take you to the Configurations section of the Model.
